 * Resetting a Handler or a Processor means flushing/cleaning all buffers, resetting internal
 * state, and getting it back to a state in which it can receive log records again.
 *
 * This is useful in case you want to avoid logs leaking between two requests or jobs when you
 * have a long running process like a worker or an application server serving multiple requests
 * in one process.
